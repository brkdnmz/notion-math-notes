## More Efficient Divisibility Check

Let‚Äôs recall the equation for a divisor $d$ of $n$:

$$
‚Åç
$$

What can we say about $k$?

It is another divisor of $n$. In fact, $d$ and $k$ are **complementary divisors of** $n$ as they complement each other.

Now, without loss of generality, let‚Äôs assume $d \le k$, that is, $d$ is the smaller divisor. What can $d$ be at most?

Multiply each side with $d$ to obtain $d^2 \le kd$. Notice that $kd = n$, thus,

$$
\begin{aligned}
d^2 &\le kd = n \\
d^2 &\le n \\
d &\le \sqrt{n}
\end{aligned}
$$

Hey, but what‚Äôs the thing? What have we just found?

Do you remember how we iterated up to $n$ to find the divisors of $n$? With this new inequality, notice that we start to search for those ‚Äúlarger‚Äù divisors once we exceed $\sqrt{n}$.

Instead of searching for the larger divisors $(k)$, we can use the smaller ones $(d)$ to obtain them, because each larger divisor complements a smaller divisor.

> Dividing $n$ by a small divisor gives the larger (complementary) divisor. In general, we can divide $n$ by $d$ to obtain $k$.

Here are some examples to find all divisors with less effort:

| $n$ | Divisors |
| --- | --- |
| $16$ | Check up to $4$: $1, 2, 4$. Then, the larger ones are $16, 8, 4$. |
| $28$ | Check up to $5$: $1, 2, 4$. Then, the larger ones are $28, 14, 7$. |
| $37$ | Check up to $6$: $1$. Then, the larger one is $37$. |
| $50$ | Check up to $7$: $1, 2, 5$. Then, the larger ones are $50, 25, 10$. |
| $100$ | Check up to $10$: $1, 2, 5, 10$. Then, the larger ones are $100, 50, 20$. Note that $10$ is the complementary divisor of itself. |

It‚Äôs time to implement this optimization!

Do you see how the divisors are listed so unorganized?

To prevent this, you may just sort the array (it‚Äôs gonna be much faster than finding the divisors), or put the larger divisors (`n/i`) into another array, then combine two arrays. Both ways are OK.

## Upper Bound for the Number of Divisors

The number of positive divisors not exceeding $\sqrt{n}$ is bounded by $\sqrt{n}$ since there is that number of positive integers.

Also, there is the same number of divisors exceeding $\sqrt{n}$ because each one complements a distinct smaller divisor.

So, the number of positive divisors is bounded by $2\sqrt{n}$.

The actual bound is smaller, you may assume it‚Äôs something like $\sqrt[3]{n}$. For $n \le 10^{12}$, the maximum number of divisors is $6720$ for $n = 963761198400$.

You may check out the script below to find the maximum number of divisors for an arbitrary limit:

```python
p = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59]

max_cnt = 0
targets = []

LIMIT = 10**12

def f(num, p_i, cnt):
    global targets, max_cnt
    if cnt > max_cnt:
        max_cnt = cnt
        targets = [num]
    elif cnt == max_cnt:
        targets.append(num)
    if p_i == len(p):
        return
    pw = 1
    while num * p[p_i] ** pw <= LIMIT:
        f(num * p[p_i] ** pw, p_i + 1, cnt * (pw + 1))
        pw += 1

f(1, 0, 1)
print("Upper bound for n:", LIMIT)
print("Integer(s) having the maximum number of divisors:", " ".join(map(str, targets)))
```

## Prime Factorization: The Most Important!

Primes are such important kinds of integers. Prime factorization is one of the most powerful tools they unlock.

In general, we can express **every** positive integer using the product of prime powers $p^e$ (ignore $1$ üòÉ):

$$
n = p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2^{e_2} \cdot p_3^{e_3} \cdots
$$

where each $p_i$ is a distinct prime.

Some examples are as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
6 &= 2 \cdot 3 \\
9 &= 3^2 \\
11 &= 11 \\
60 &= 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \\
210 &= 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \\
360360 &= 2^3 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 11 \cdot 13
\end{aligned}
$$

We mentioned that primes are the purest integers. That‚Äôs because they **cannot be factorized further**, and therefore, each integer‚Äôs prime factorization is **unique**.

Anyway, how can we factorize an integer?

Remember the method to find the divisors. We just iterate over integers and use the modulo operation to check whether they divide $n$.

What do you think the first integer after $1$ that divides $n$ is?

- Spoiler (try to find out yourself ü§î)
    
    It‚Äôs the smallest prime divisor! If we assume not, then it would be composite integer divisible by a prime, which would be the first integer dividing $n$, hence the contradiction.
    

## Factorizing an Integer

### *Before reading this section, make sure to open the spoiler above.*

We can iterate up to $\sqrt{n}$ as if we were finding the divisors. When we encounter the first divisor $d_0$, we know that it‚Äôs prime. It‚Äôs time to find its exponent in factorization.

We can divide $n$ by $d_0$ as long as it‚Äôs divisible. Let‚Äôs denote the updated $n$ after this operation with $n'$.

The process is the same for $n'$:

> Find the first divisor $d_1$ (which is also going to be a prime), and repeatedly divide by $d_1$. Note that $d_0$ does not divide $n'$, which is why $d_1$ is the second smallest prime divisor of $n$.
> 

This goes on until $n'$ becomes $1$. However, when $n'$ becomes a prime, the loop terminates without encountering the last prime divisor, which is $n'$ itself. We should handle this after the loop, checking whether $n' > 1$.

One important point to highlight is that we don‚Äôt start the iteration from $1$ every time $n$ is updated. We just continue because we know that the next prime divisor is definitely larger. So, it also takes at most $\sqrt{n}$ iterations. We say ‚Äúat most‚Äù because notice that $n$ becomes smaller after every division by prime divisor, so does $\sqrt{n}$. For example, it takes a single iteration for every power of $2$. The worst case is that $n$ is a prime itself, for which there are always $\sqrt{n}$ iterations.

Let‚Äôs implement the prime factorization!

```cpp
// https://ideone.com/NH7x3F
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;

// Wrapper for prime factorization elements
struct Divisor {
    ll prime;
    int exponent;
};

int main() {
    ll n = 10512969114312ll; // Put ll or LL to the end to specify 64-bit literal
    vector<Divisor> prime_powers;
    ll initial_n = n;
    for (int i = 2; 1ll * i * i <= n; i++) {
        if (n % i)
            continue; // r > 0
        // i is a prime divisor
        Divisor divisor{i, 0};
        // While n is divisible by i, divide and increment the exponent
        // Observe that n itself is modified. Therefore, the loop condition changes.
        while (n % i == 0) {
            n /= i;
            divisor.exponent++;
        }
        // The prime factorization includes "divisor"
        prime_powers.push_back(divisor);
    }
    // n became a prime itself
    if (n > 1) {
        // Factorization includes n^1
        prime_powers.push_back(Divisor{n, 1});
    }
    cout << "n = " << initial_n << " = ";
    for (Divisor d : prime_powers) {
        cout << d.prime << "^" << d.exponent;
        if (d.prime != prime_powers.back().prime)
            cout << " * ";
    }
    cout << "\n";
}
```

```python
# https://ideone.com/uZvoXM
class Divisor:
    def __init__(self, prime: int, exponent: int) -> None:
        self.prime = prime
        self.exponent = exponent

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.prime}^{self.exponent}"

n = 10512969114312
initial_n = n
divisors: "list[Divisor]" = []

for i in range(2, n + 1):
    if i**2 > n:  # To break when exceeded sqrt(n)
        break
    if n % i:  # r > 0
        continue

    d = Divisor(i, 0)
    while n % i == 0:
        n //= i
        d.exponent += 1
    divisors.append(d)

if n > 1:
    divisors.append(Divisor(n, 1))

print(f"n = {initial_n} = {' * '.join(map(str, divisors))}")
```

### Output

```
n = 10512969114312 = 2^3 * 3^5 * 7^2 * 101^1 * 103^3
```

### Number of Prime Divisors

For an integer $x = p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2^{e_2} \cdot p_3^{e_3} \cdots$, say $x$ has $e_1 + e_2 + e_3 + \cdots$ prime divisors. What can we tell about the maximum number of prime divisors a number not exceeding an upper bound $n$?

Since each prime we ‚Äúadd‚Äù to the prime factorization increments the number of prime divisors, we can always greedily add $2$. Then, we are left with $2^k \le n$, and thus, $k \le \log_2{n}$.

### Number of Distinct Prime Divisors

This time, we can greedily multiply by the next smallest prime divisor not used yet: $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 11 \cdots \le n$.

If there are $k$ of them since each prime other than $2$ is greater than $2$, we can write $2^k \le n$, and obtain $k \le \log_2{n}$ again. Of course, the real bound is smaller; however, we don‚Äôt need to find it since the logarithmic bound is small enough. üòé
