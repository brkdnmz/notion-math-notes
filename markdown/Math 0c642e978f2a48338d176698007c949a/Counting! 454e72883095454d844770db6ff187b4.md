# Counting!

## We have all been high schoolers once, and there was this topic about counting stuff: *combinatorics*.

## Factorials

Factorials are the building blocks of counting. They are the most atomic elements after integers when it comes to counting.

The term “factorial” needs a non-negative integer $n$ to be defined, that is, “**factorial of $n$”** is defined as the product of all positive integers up to $n$. It is denoted with $n!$:

$$
n! = \prod_{i=1}^{n} i = 1 \cdot 2 \cdots n
$$

Additionally, $0! = 1$. They can also be defined recursively:

$$
n! =
\begin{cases}
0, & n = 0 \\
n \cdot (n-1)!, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

They are used to describe more complex stuff, such as binomial coefficients.

$n!$ itself represents the number of ways to arrange $n$ different items, like the integers from $1$ to $n$ (permutations!).

## Implementation

```cpp
// https://ideone.com/qH1Y3q
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;

ll factorial(int n) {
    ll res = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        res *= i;
    }
    return res;
}

ll factorial_recursive(int n) {
    if (!n)
        return 1;
    return n * factorial_recursive(n - 1);
}

void print_factorials(int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        cout << i << "!:";
        if (i < 10)
            cout << "\t";
        cout << " ";
        cout << factorial(i) << " (iterative), ";
        cout << factorial_recursive(i) << " (recursive)\n";
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 25;
    print_factorials(n);
}
```

```python
# https://ideone.com/sGIb7X
def factorial(n: int) -> int:
    res = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        res *= i
    return res

def factorial_recursive(n: int) -> int:
    if not n:
        return 1
    return n * factorial_recursive(n - 1)

def print_factorials(n: int) -> int:
    for i in range(n + 1):
        print(f"{i}!:", end="")
        if i < 10:
            print("\t", end="")
        print(" ", end="")

        print(f"{factorial(i)} (iterative), {factorial_recursive(i)} (recursive)")

n = 25
print_factorials(n)
```

What happened to the C++ after $20!$?

That strange number resulted from overflow. Recall that in C++, `long long` is the 64-bit signed integer type, whose upper bound is $2^{63} - 1 \approx 9 \cdot 10^{18}$, whereas $21! \approx 51 \cdot 10^{18}$.

We’ll discuss how to “avoid” this issue in C++.

## Binomial Coefficients, a.k.a. $\binom{n}{k}$

The most memorable signature from the high school has been $\binom{n}{k}$ ($n$ choose $k$) which basically stands for the number of ways to choose $k$ different items among $n$ different items. Literally, every answer to a counting problem can be expressed using binomial coefficients in a reasonable manner.

As mentioned previously, a binomial coefficient $\binom{n}{k}$ $(0 \le k \le n)$ can be defined involving factorials:

$$
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{(n-k)! \cdot k!}
$$

And, it is undefined (or $0$) for $k > n$. We consider it $0$ in our computations.

It can also be defined recursively:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k}
\end{aligned}
$$

One way to derive this formula is to derive the problem of finding the number of ways to choose $k$ different items among $n$ different items into $2$ separate cases depending on the last item:

1. We choose the last item, then choose $k-1$ items among the first $n-1$ items $\to \binom{n-1}{k-1}$,
2. We don’t choose the last item, choose $k$ items among the first $n-1$ items $\to \binom{n-1}{k}$.

Hence the formula. There are several other ways, some of which involve [Pascal’s triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle).

## Implementation

```cpp
// https://ideone.com/tlbrtz
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;

ll factorial(int n) {
    ll res = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        res *= i;
    }
    return res;
}

// We abbreviate "binomial coefficient" as "C" standing for "Combination".
ll C(int n, int k) {
    if (k > n)
        return 0;
    // numerator == n!
    // denominator = (n-k)! * k!
    ll numerator = factorial(n), denominator = factorial(n - k) * factorial(k);
    return numerator / denominator;
}

void print_binomial_coefficients(int n) {
    ll C_table[n + 1][n + 1];
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++) {
            if (i < j) {
                C_table[i][j] = 0;
                continue;
            }
            if (!j) {
                C_table[i][j] = 1;
                continue;
            }
            C_table[i][j] = C_table[i - 1][j - 1] + C_table[i - 1][j]; // even if i-1 < j, C_table[i-1][j] = 0, no problem here!
        }
    }
    cout << "Binomial coefficients calculated w/ factorial (left) vs. w/ recursive formula (right)\n";
    int n_examples = 10;
    for (int i = 0; i < n_examples; i++) {
        cout << i + 1 << ".\t";
        int rand_n = rand() % n;
        int rand_k = rand() % (rand_n + 1);
        cout << "n = " << rand_n << ", k = " << rand_k << ", C(n, k): " << C(rand_n, rand_k) << " vs. " << C_table[rand_n][rand_k] << "\n";
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 30;
    print_binomial_coefficients(n);
}
```

### Output

```
Binomial coefficients calculated w/ factorial (left) vs. w/ recursive formula (right)
1.	n = 13, k = 4, C(n, k): 715 vs. 715
2.	n = 27, k = 19, C(n, k): 2 vs. 2220075
3.	n = 23, k = 7, C(n, k): 77 vs. 245157
4.	n = 16, k = 14, C(n, k): 120 vs. 120
5.	n = 9, k = 1, C(n, k): 9 vs. 9
6.	n = 2, k = 1, C(n, k): 2 vs. 2
7.	n = 20, k = 4, C(n, k): 4845 vs. 4845
8.	n = 23, k = 22, C(n, k): -6 vs. 23
9.	n = 0, k = 0, C(n, k): 1 vs. 1
10.	n = 22, k = 12, C(n, k): -719 vs. 646646
```

See? We got weird differences again. For $n \le 30$, every possible binomial coefficient fits in even $32$-bit signed integer type. This is why the recursive formula, which only adds two smaller values together, resulted in the actual values, whereas the other formula involving factorials resulted in overflowed values.

### What’s this, are we seriously limited to so small values to avoid overflows? Such a disappointment!

Nope, as you know, Python supports unbounded integers by default. But true competitive programmers use C++, which limits them to 64 bits.
