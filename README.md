# Math Notes for Competitive Programming

### Hi!

This repository contains the HTML and Markdown versions of my math notes I prepared using Notion. I created the repository just to reflect my work, and to keep my notes in GitHub also :)

Visit **[here](https://ethereal-expansion-d0a.notion.site/Math-0c642e978f2a48338d176698007c949a)** to open the notes in Notion.

## Topics Covered
- **Divisors & Divisibility**
- **Prime Factorization**
- **Sieve of Eratosthenes *(and other Sieve-like algorithms)***
- **GCD & LCM**
- **Combinatorics *(Factorials, Binomial Coefficients, Counting etc.)***
- **Modular Arithmetic (a.k.a. $\bmod 10^9 + 7$)**
- **Binary Exponentiation**
- **Additional Tips & Tricks**
